/*
Task#1:
When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. In this example, the value of testername is changed
from "Asad" to "Khalid".
 
let testername = "Asad";
testername = "Khalid";

Note that when reassigning a variable that has already been declared, you do not use the let keyword.
You need to assign anyone's name in "testname" and then reassign variable with your name and print it using console.log() function.
*/

/* Solution */

let testername = "Rumman";
testername = "Farhan";
console.log("Tester name is: " + testername);

/*
Task#2:
In JavaScript, when variable name is have more than one word like "firstvariable" then there is a specific naming convention to use is camel case. Like
let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
In Task#1, update the variable name and use camel case naming convention.
*/
/* Solution */
let cqeName = "Rumman";
cqeName = "Farhan";
console.log("CQE name is: " + cqeName);
